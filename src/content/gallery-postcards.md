        Thank you for the postal you sent me long ago. It was a dandy. You must be an artist by this time. What do you think? It was 28 degrees zero here this morning. We don't feel the cold as much here as in Nebr. It very seldom storms. Did you finish husking corn before the winter set in? I really hope you did. I like my new home very much. Wouldn't go back to Marquette to live. Do you ever go over to the Danish Church? Suppose you kan Yende Axel. He killed a deer not a dear. Lots of the d-e-e-r-s up here. I'll send a little zero weather with this. Best regards from Gayman.

        Do you still study music? I'm so inquisitive, excuse me, Alaise

He can skip over rocks & not hurt his bare feet. He will put 100 pounds on his back & walk away with it. Climbs a tree like a squirrel gets his living mostly from hunting & fishing. He cooks fine bread.

        I will have to close the letter on this card & try to get it off to another cross country P.O. by a man who is going in tomorrow. I'll get another letter off about the middle of the week so you ought to get it by Sun. the 24. Goodbye I'll be home soon & then will continue the line till you get back.

        Write when you get time. Brad is at home now, got a letter from him, Wally
